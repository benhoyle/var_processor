start=\"200.21\" dur=\"4.44\">influences down to our own day is one of</text><text start=\"202.73\" dur=\"4.35\">the most famous philosophers in our time</text><text start=\"204.65\" dur=\"4.77\">a jair who has written a great deal</text><text start=\"207.08\" dur=\"5.31\">about Russell including the best short</text><text start=\"209.42\" dur=\"4.89\">introductory book on Russell&amp;#39;s work but</text><text start=\"212.39\" dur=\"4.26\">that&amp;#39;s right let&amp;#39;s start with Frager as</text><text start=\"214.31\" dur=\"5.43\">being the earliest figure when he began</text><text start=\"216.65\" dur=\"7.59\">what was it he was trying to do well he</text><text start=\"219.74\" dur=\"7.14\">was trying to make up what he thought</text><text start=\"224.24\" dur=\"4.86\">well deficiencies in arithmetic he</text><text start=\"226.88\" dur=\"5.7\">thought that mathematical statements as</text><text start=\"229.1\" dur=\"5.01\">they were expressing his day were not</text><text start=\"232.58\" dur=\"3.15\">sufficiently precise and that</text><text start=\"234.11\" dur=\"4.35\">mathematical proofs were not</text><text start=\"235.73\" dur=\"4.86\">sufficiently rigorous and so he began by</text><text start=\"238.46\" dur=\"4.29\">trying to develop a notation the belief</text><text start=\"240.59\" dur=\"4.62\">shift he referred to in which to become</text><text start=\"242.75\" dur=\"5.64\">good in which this will be remedied and</text><text start=\"245.21\" dur=\"5.61\">occasions to show exactly what measure</text><text start=\"248.39\" dur=\"4.56\">met men medical statement stated and</text><text start=\"250.82\" dur=\"4.71\">exactly what their proof statistically</text><text start=\"252.95\" dur=\"5.099\">was first made obvious how one step in</text><text start=\"255.53\" dur=\"4.68\">the proof succeeded another and this is</text><text start=\"258.049\" dur=\"5.551\">deficient in mathematics in his time</text><text start=\"260.21\" dur=\"6.12\">applying even to Euclid where there were</text><text start=\"263.6\" dur=\"4.68\">assumptions not made explicit for power</text><text start=\"266.33\" dur=\"3.989\">fidelity wasn&amp;#39;t one of the points</text><text start=\"268.28\" dur=\"4.53\">involved that every argument including a</text><text start=\"270.319\" dur=\"5.34\">mathematical proof has to have premises</text><text start=\"272.81\" dur=\"5.699\">and what those premises are often</text><text start=\"275.659\" dur=\"4.921\">creates problems and he tried to show</text><text start=\"278.509\" dur=\"4.41\">that all mathematics was ultimately</text><text start=\"280.58\" dur=\"5.97\">derived from pure principles of logic</text><text start=\"282.919\" dur=\"6.511\">exactly his mercy and Russell did this</text><text start=\"286.55\" dur=\"5.76\">and this involved to enterprise is first</text><text start=\"289.43\" dur=\"5.4\">of all defining mathematical concepts</text><text start=\"292.31\" dur=\"4.829\">enjoy logical one and secondly showing</text><text start=\"294.83\" dur=\"4.619\">that mathematics recently gave me how</text><text start=\"297.139\" dur=\"5.31\">not all mathematics but arithmetic was</text><text start=\"299.449\" dur=\"6.601\">reducible from Charlie logical premises</text><text start=\"302.449\" dur=\"6.18\">and this was achieved the first part was</text><text start=\"306.05\" dur=\"4.739\">a she&amp;#39;d fairly simply I think that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"308.629\" dur=\"5.84\">important station will show higher to</text><text start=\"310.789\" dur=\"7.771\">some if you take say a couple let&amp;#39;s take</text><text start=\"314.469\" dur=\"6.611\">Tom and Jerry then you can define them</text><text start=\"318.56\" dur=\"5.4\">as a couple by saying that they are both</text><text start=\"321.08\" dur=\"4.559\">members of the set and anything which</text><text start=\"323.96\" dur=\"3.84\">remember was set aside is identical with</text><text start=\"325.639\" dur=\"5.34\">one or other of them they will define</text><text start=\"327.8\" dur=\"4.95\">the number two as a set of subsets for</text><text start=\"330.979\" dur=\"3.9\">set of couples and we do this for all</text><text start=\"332.75\" dur=\"4.62\">numbers more certain complications about</text><text start=\"334.879\" dur=\"5.28\">infinity but in this way you can define</text><text start=\"337.37\" dur=\"6.949\">a cardinal number in purely logical</text><text start=\"340.159\" dur=\"8.19\">terms what he did and then also by</text><text start=\"344.319\" dur=\"5.891\">generalizing logic which had until to</text><text start=\"348.349\" dur=\"4.38\">been done a zillion logic which had</text><text start=\"350.21\" dur=\"5.129\">prevailed or from ancient times until</text><text start=\"352.729\" dur=\"8.15\">the 19th century was not wholly general</text><text start=\"355.339\" dur=\"8.281\">he was able to state premises from which</text><text start=\"360.879\" dur=\"4.931\">most risk equals Abdullah&amp;#39;s reducible it</text><text start=\"363.62\" dur=\"6.06\">was shown later by somebody about our</text><text start=\"365.81\" dur=\"5.37\">the logician the Austrian girdle that in</text><text start=\"369.68\" dur=\"3.72\">fact this couldn&amp;#39;t be can pick you down</text><text start=\"371.18\" dur=\"4.47\">the diversity couldn&amp;#39;t be completed but</text><text start=\"373.4\" dur=\"4.379\">the intrabody could be completed figure</text><text start=\"375.65\" dur=\"4.71\">a method of doing it wouldn&amp;#39;t it also be</text><text start=\"377.779\" dur=\"4.411\">true to say that the full Frager of the</text><text start=\"380.36\" dur=\"3.929\">laws of logic had been regarded as laws</text><text start=\"382.19\" dur=\"4.92\">of thought that&amp;#39;s to say of something to</text><text start=\"384.289\" dur=\"3.451\">do with human mental processes but</text><text start=\"387.11\" dur=\"2.97\">Frager</text><text start=\"387.74\" dur=\"5.039\">realized that that but this couldn&amp;#39;t be</text><text start=\"390.08\" dur=\"5.55\">so that the validity of a proof couldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"392.779\" dur=\"4.531\">depend on our psychology oh yes this was</text><text start=\"395.63\" dur=\"4.019\">very important this is one of one of the</text><text start=\"397.31\" dur=\"2.67\">most important things that Sega did and</text><text start=\"399.649\" dur=\"3.211\">he</text><text start=\"399.98\" dur=\"6.18\">again by one of his early work was an</text><text start=\"402.86\" dur=\"6.06\">attack on a book of autistic by James</text><text start=\"406.16\" dur=\"5.04\">Lafleur called his cell in which logic</text><text start=\"408.92\" dur=\"5.19\">was represented as a theory of judgment</text><text start=\"411.2\" dur=\"5.73\">and this was hybrid ruled by the German</text><text start=\"414.11\" dur=\"4.8\">idealists and fragrance sisters it was</text><text start=\"416.93\" dur=\"6.45\">entirely objective and I could do it</text><text start=\"418.91\" dur=\"6.24\">with psychological processes but set in</text><text start=\"423.38\" dur=\"4.79\">Capriccio deuce numbers were entirely</text><text start=\"425.15\" dur=\"6.12\">objective things and that logic was</text><text start=\"428.17\" dur=\"5.47\">cracking dependent or of wasn&amp;#39;t about</text><text start=\"431.27\" dur=\"5.43\">psychology at all these were objective</text><text start=\"433.64\" dur=\"5.07\">truths which of course the mind is</text><text start=\"436.7\" dur=\"4.62\">capable of gasping they didn&amp;#39;t depend</text><text start=\"438.71\" dur=\"4.53\">upon features of thinking so the search</text><text start=\"441.32\" dur=\"4.8\">then becomes in a matter Batman ematic</text><text start=\"443.24\" dur=\"5.75\">aloof for watching tears that the proof</text><text start=\"446.12\" dur=\"5.16\">conveys from step to step attracts that</text><text start=\"448.99\" dur=\"4.48\">impersonally validates the conclusion</text><text start=\"451.28\" dur=\"5.25\">after regardless of how we think and</text><text start=\"453.47\" dur=\"5.73\">this in a way accounts for figure having</text><text start=\"456.53\" dur=\"4.2\">a sucessful interest beyond his 20</text><text start=\"459.2\" dur=\"5.01\">mathematical work but what he also</text><text start=\"460.73\" dur=\"6.99\">developed a theory of meaning a theory</text><text start=\"464.21\" dur=\"6.33\">of meaning which would show how</text><text start=\"467.72\" dur=\"7.37\">mathematics could be objectively valid</text><text start=\"470.54\" dur=\"8.07\">and he talked of the he tied up the</text><text start=\"475.09\" dur=\"4.93\">meaning of measure of statement but it</text><text start=\"478.61\" dur=\"5.16\">could be said to state was in general</text><text start=\"480.02\" dur=\"6.12\">with truth conditions with with the</text><text start=\"483.77\" dur=\"4.89\">features in them that made them</text><text start=\"486.14\" dur=\"4.74\">candidates for tools of office I suppose</text><text start=\"488.66\" dur=\"4.02\">the most historically influential</text><text start=\"490.88\" dur=\"3.63\">distinction that he introduced was the</text><text start=\"492.68\" dur=\"3\">distinction between sense and reference</text><text start=\"494.51\" dur=\"2.46\">mm-hm</text><text start=\"495.68\" dur=\"2.67\">which has to do with his theory of</text><text start=\"496.97\" dur=\"3.42\">meaning and one still has people</text><text start=\"498.35\" dur=\"4.26\">constantly referring to this can you</text><text start=\"500.39\" dur=\"4.44\">explain it yes it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fairly it&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"502.61\" dur=\"4.08\">fairly complicated the tool German</text><text start=\"504.83\" dur=\"4.14\">accessions ours in which is generally</text><text start=\"506.69\" dur=\"5.49\">associated sense and the duck tongue</text><text start=\"508.97\" dur=\"6.03\">which is translated what is it that the</text><text start=\"512.18\" dur=\"4.11\">German word for meaning but is bad loss</text><text start=\"515\" dur=\"5.75\">was usually translated as either</text><text start=\"516.29\" dur=\"8.46\">reference or unification and the</text><text start=\"520.75\" dur=\"6.58\">denotation of a name is the object to</text><text start=\"524.75\" dur=\"6.81\">which it which it names I mean</text><text start=\"527.33\" dur=\"5.78\">communication of Brahmaji is is you the</text><text start=\"531.56\" dur=\"6.6\">actual stuff</text><text start=\"533.11\" dur=\"9.88\">whereas the sense of them is the</text><text start=\"538.16\" dur=\"9.45\">contribution that it makes to the</text><text start=\"542.99\" dur=\"7.35\">meaning and if I just say Tom you have</text><text start=\"547.61\" dur=\"6.27\">say to me who&amp;#39;s Tom and then I say well</text><text start=\"550.34\" dur=\"5.49\">Tom Easterners Baba and all the person</text><text start=\"553.88\" dur=\"3.57\">who invented such and such or all the</text><text start=\"555.83\" dur=\"3.84\">first person the titles of a mountain</text><text start=\"557.45\" dur=\"5.13\">and in this way I give you a sense and</text><text start=\"559.67\" dur=\"5.97\">in this way I&amp;#39;m able to identify him now</text><text start=\"562.58\" dur=\"6.42\">this distinction becomes important in</text><text start=\"565.64\" dur=\"5.97\">certain contexts generally what you care</text><text start=\"569\" dur=\"5.43\">about in the case of a name is what the</text><text start=\"571.61\" dur=\"5.31\">name stands for and but there are</text><text start=\"574.43\" dur=\"6.48\">certain cases where it&amp;#39;s important to</text><text start=\"576.92\" dur=\"6.6\">make a distinction between sense and</text><text start=\"580.91\" dur=\"5.37\">unification and one good example would</text><text start=\"583.52\" dur=\"5.25\">be statement to identity the frege&amp;#39;s own</text><text start=\"586.28\" dur=\"6.24\">a favorite example was that of the</text><text start=\"588.77\" dur=\"7.05\">evening star and the morning star both</text><text start=\"592.52\" dur=\"6.24\">of which as you know are very same stuff</text><text start=\"595.82\" dur=\"6.09\">they have our Venus yeah and but if</text><text start=\"598.76\" dur=\"6.24\">someone says leading stars identify the</text><text start=\"601.91\" dur=\"5.82\">morning star a man takes the reference</text><text start=\"605\" dur=\"5.31\">of these two expressions to be a lady</text><text start=\"607.73\" dur=\"4.56\">notation then he simply saying Venus is</text><text start=\"610.31\" dur=\"3.45\">Venus which is a tautology and of no</text><text start=\"612.29\" dur=\"3.21\">interest whereas in fact the morning</text><text start=\"613.76\" dur=\"4.43\">star in the unisza is a mathematical</text><text start=\"615.5\" dur=\"5.16\">discovery and therefore in this usage</text><text start=\"618.19\" dur=\"4.99\">but the excessive desert who is not</text><text start=\"620.66\" dur=\"5.82\">study notation not the objects but their</text><text start=\"623.18\" dur=\"5.7\">senses so in other words he analyzed</text><text start=\"626.48\" dur=\"6.24\">that may have a sense but not have a</text><text start=\"628.88\" dur=\"7.49\">reference yes this can happen but in Rob</text><text start=\"632.72\" dur=\"8.19\">in well this happens in two ways and</text><text start=\"636.37\" dur=\"9.1\">there could be name or nominal</text><text start=\"640.91\" dur=\"6.5\">expressions like here for example which</text><text start=\"645.47\" dur=\"6\">have a sense but no reference because</text><text start=\"647.41\" dur=\"6.72\">nobody car correspond to it and also</text><text start=\"651.47\" dur=\"6.24\">there is a complicated case of</text><text start=\"654.13\" dur=\"6.64\">expressions which have a function in in</text><text start=\"657.71\" dur=\"6.36\">a sentence as significant to it making</text><text start=\"660.77\" dur=\"5.07\">it capable of intro false</text><text start=\"664.07\" dur=\"3.049\">but don&amp;#39;t you know the same like</text><text start=\"665.84\" dur=\"4.65\">predicate</text><text start=\"667.119\" dur=\"5.41\">is-is-is good is bad it&amp;#39;s Lanza which</text><text start=\"670.49\" dur=\"5.25\">themselves are what he call it beat</text><text start=\"672.529\" dur=\"5.67\">expressions namely don&amp;#39;t hit themselves</text><text start=\"675.74\" dur=\"5.19\">have a reference but contribute to</text><text start=\"678.199\" dur=\"4.651\">giving the sentence a sense and through</text><text start=\"680.93\" dur=\"4.139\">its sensor reference and these</text><text start=\"682.85\" dur=\"4.829\">distinctions that he introduced and his</text><text start=\"685.069\" dur=\"4.5\">theory of meeting had in fact had a very</text><text start=\"687.679\" dur=\"3.96\">widespread influence in philosophy and</text><text start=\"689.569\" dur=\"4.11\">they&amp;#39;ve become very fashionable in</text><text start=\"691.639\" dur=\"6.99\">recent years and you say and and there&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"693.679\" dur=\"7.71\">been a change in the anyhow in England</text><text start=\"698.629\" dur=\"6.21\">and testable in the del United States</text><text start=\"701.389\" dur=\"5.64\">are extended a change in the main</text><text start=\"704.839\" dur=\"4.44\">concern of loss it&amp;#39;s a very long time</text><text start=\"707.029\" dur=\"7.47\">the theory of knowledge was dominant</text><text start=\"709.279\" dur=\"7.47\">ever since Descartes in the seventeenth</text><text start=\"714.499\" dur=\"4.921\">century the main concerns in a theory of</text><text start=\"716.749\" dur=\"5.041\">knowledge what be what what we can know</text><text start=\"719.42\" dur=\"4.5\">and how we can know how we are justified</text><text start=\"721.79\" dur=\"4.2\">know it in the beliefs we do and in</text><text start=\"723.92\" dur=\"4.07\">recent years has given way to what</text><text start=\"725.99\" dur=\"5.009\">sometimes called the philosophy of logic</text><text start=\"727.99\" dur=\"6.279\">which is mainly concerned with questions</text><text start=\"730.999\" dur=\"4.801\">about meaning and here sega&amp;#39;s coming to</text><text start=\"734.269\" dur=\"3.63\">great prominence from Princeton&amp;#39;s my</text><text start=\"735.8\" dur=\"5.159\">successors successor of logic at oxford</text><text start=\"737.899\" dur=\"6.451\">the macadam it has rotated nearly i mean</text><text start=\"740.959\" dur=\"6.06\">certainly two large books to sega&amp;#39;s work</text><text start=\"744.35\" dur=\"4.95\">and is concerned exploring the</text><text start=\"747.019\" dur=\"3.36\">implications of frege&amp;#39;s distinction for</text><text start=\"749.3\" dur=\"3.36\">a theory of meaning</text><text start=\"750.379\" dur=\"4.531\">so Michael Dermott who I suppose it must</text><text start=\"752.66\" dur=\"4.289\">be called the leading living commentator</text><text start=\"754.91\" dur=\"4.049\">on fragrance makes enormously large</text><text start=\"756.949\" dur=\"4.32\">claims for him lovely he says that he&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"758.959\" dur=\"6.06\">introduced a whole new era in philosophy</text><text start=\"761.269\" dur=\"5.79\">but he has D psychologize philosophy but</text><text start=\"765.019\" dur=\"4.53\">in the way you just explained he he</text><text start=\"767.059\" dur=\"4.07\">throws the theory of knowledge from the</text><text start=\"769.549\" dur=\"4.02\">center of the law and this has changed</text><text start=\"771.129\" dur=\"4.3\">300 years of philosophical development</text><text start=\"773.569\" dur=\"3.96\">well I think you go along with that well</text><text start=\"775.429\" dur=\"4.41\">I think that there has been a different</text><text start=\"777.529\" dur=\"4.23\">emphasis but I think that Michael</text><text start=\"779.839\" dur=\"4.11\">exaggerated in two ways first of all</text><text start=\"781.759\" dur=\"3.961\">Russell&amp;#39;s are always been concerned with</text><text start=\"783.949\" dur=\"4.771\">meaning ever since Socrates</text><text start=\"785.72\" dur=\"5.279\">went about saying what is knowledge what</text><text start=\"788.72\" dur=\"4.589\">is what is goodness and so on which is a</text><text start=\"790.999\" dur=\"3.78\">way of asking what what feeds about the</text><text start=\"793.309\" dur=\"4.421\">grease turbulence of these terms meant</text><text start=\"794.779\" dur=\"6.281\">was always an interest in in meaning is</text><text start=\"797.73\" dur=\"4.8\">in in fluffier and secondly I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"801.06\" dur=\"3.57\">think interest in the theory of</text><text start=\"802.53\" dur=\"4.44\">knowledge and certainly disappeared I</text><text start=\"804.63\" dur=\"5.19\">think it I think that there are some</text><text start=\"806.97\" dur=\"6.48\">people who are connected with with with</text><text start=\"809.82\" dur=\"6.81\">concern to this and insofar as even in</text><text start=\"813.45\" dur=\"7.59\">academics own work the area meaning is</text><text start=\"816.63\" dur=\"6.6\">very much bound up with questions about</text><text start=\"821.04\" dur=\"4.17\">truth and falsehood this also doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"823.23\" dur=\"3.36\">entirely take us away from the idea of</text><text start=\"825.21\" dur=\"3\">knowledge because after all as Illinois</text><text start=\"826.59\" dur=\"3.24\">is concerned with what reason we have to</text><text start=\"828.21\" dur=\"4.05\">suppose that certain statements</text><text start=\"829.83\" dur=\"4.41\">propositions are true or false so I</text><text start=\"832.26\" dur=\"5.73\">think that they had initiative emphasis</text><text start=\"834.24\" dur=\"6\">but not the great break the damage</text><text start=\"837.99\" dur=\"4.14\">insist on before we continue with the</text><text start=\"840.24\" dur=\"4.11\">more recent applications of the frege&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"842.13\" dur=\"4.71\">work I want to turn to Russell for a</text><text start=\"844.35\" dur=\"4.17\">moment when I introduced this discussion</text><text start=\"846.84\" dur=\"3.81\">I emphasized the fact that Frager worked</text><text start=\"848.52\" dur=\"3.72\">in isolation throughout almost the whole</text><text start=\"850.65\" dur=\"3.51\">of his life and this becomes very</text><text start=\"852.24\" dur=\"4.32\">important when one starts to consider</text><text start=\"854.16\" dur=\"4.82\">Russell

start=\"861.39\" dur=\"4.38\">done without realizing he&amp;#39;d done it</text><text start=\"863.28\" dur=\"5.25\">didn&amp;#39;t be capture that should make it</text><text start=\"865.77\" dur=\"4.2\">rather easy for you to explain to us</text><text start=\"868.53\" dur=\"3.51\">something about the importance of</text><text start=\"869.97\" dur=\"5.19\">Russell&amp;#39;s very early well I don&amp;#39;t quite</text><text start=\"872.04\" dur=\"5.7\">know I would say poor Russell because it</text><text start=\"875.16\" dur=\"5.91\">gets like true that Russell did a lot of</text><text start=\"877.74\" dur=\"7.44\">work that Vega had done before him but</text><text start=\"881.07\" dur=\"7.44\">Russell also exposed a fatal deficiency</text><text start=\"885.18\" dur=\"5.79\">in Vegas system he showed the Vegas</text><text start=\"888.51\" dur=\"4.32\">system of logic actually contained the</text><text start=\"890.97\" dur=\"3.84\">paradox that it knows who should

start=\"897.09\" dur=\"5.52\">and it comes into the category of</text><text start=\"900.3\" dur=\"3.9\">self-defeating proposition and in well</text><text start=\"902.61\" dur=\"3.69\">although on the surface it seems to be</text><text start=\"904.2\" dur=\"4.2\">trivial it&amp;#39;s not trivial beneficial it</text><text start=\"906.3\" dur=\"3.48\">shows that the underlying argumentation</text><text start=\"908.4\" dur=\"5.07\">has something wrong with it he does it</text><text start=\"909.78\" dur=\"6.72\">shows one of one of Sega&amp;#39;s essential</text><text start=\"913.47\" dur=\"5.4\">assumptions lead contradiction and when</text><text start=\"916.5\" dur=\"5.43\">and Russell in nineteen that he wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"918.87\" dur=\"5.91\">making three conveyed this in a letter</text><text start=\"921.93\" dur=\"5.19\">to Frager and Sega&amp;#39;s first reaction was</text><text start=\"924.78\" dur=\"4.2\">not oh I&amp;#39;m wrong you&amp;#39;ve seen the</text><text start=\"927.12\" dur=\"4.13\">arrogance reply the whole of mathematics</text><text start=\"928.98\" dur=\"6.03\">has been shown to be

start=\"966.93\" dur=\"3.45\">the result he thought his life&amp;#39;s work</text><text start=\"968.16\" dur=\"6.69\">and his life had been demolished yes yes</text><text start=\"970.38\" dur=\"7.29\">so that in fact it was very sad story</text><text start=\"974.85\" dur=\"5.13\">yeah can his only it remains true I had</text><text start=\"977.67\" dur=\"4.89\">oughta press this point but an enormous</text><text start=\"979.98\" dur=\"4.919\">amount of the work that Russell had done</text><text start=\"982.56\" dur=\"4.86\">and spent years over fraida had already</text><text start=\"984.899\" dur=\"4.831\">died and Russell didn&amp;#39;t know that issue</text><text start=\"987.42\" dur=\"4.919\">but it&amp;#39;s also true but although favor</text><text start=\"989.73\" dur=\"4.049\">did its first and some experts today</text><text start=\"992.339\" dur=\"4.081\">think that they did did most of it</text><text start=\"993.779\" dur=\"4.591\">better it was through Russell that the</text><text start=\"996.42\" dur=\"3.63\">ideas actually became famous in</text><text start=\"998.37\" dur=\"4.17\">philosophy and influential in philosophy</text><text start=\"1000.05\" dur=\"5.94\">that is true I don&amp;#39;t know why it was the</text><text start=\"1002.54\" dur=\"8.549\">figures work was so neglected a park</text><text start=\"1005.99\" dur=\"7.53\">across from third reason that interest</text><text start=\"1011.089\" dur=\"3.99\">in new developments of logic was very</text><text start=\"1013.52\" dur=\"4.64\">much in English seeing

start=\"1036.5\" dur=\"3.15\">but even roughly but indirectly what</text><text start=\"1038.42\" dur=\"2.97\">happened was the Russell and</text><text start=\"1039.65\" dur=\"4.38\">collaborator white-haired went to a</text><text start=\"1041.39\" dur=\"6.78\">Congress in Paris in nineteen three I</text><text start=\"1044.03\" dur=\"6.99\">met Natalia logician called piano and it</text><text start=\"1048.17\" dur=\"4.86\">was super on Oh who&amp;#39;s working normally</text><text start=\"1051.02\" dur=\"3.36\">best them and who was working in the</text><text start=\"1053.03\" dur=\"4.14\">same direction though we were less</text><text start=\"1054.38\" dur=\"4.65\">efficient at the science of logic which</text><text start=\"1057.17\" dur=\"4.92\">had remained virtually static for over</text><text start=\"1059.03\" dur=\"5.78\">2,000 years since Aristotle suddenly</text><text start=\"1062.09\" dur=\"4.91\">exploded their whole new</text><text start=\"1064.81\" dur=\"4.41\">and in normal you know I feel so rough</text><text start=\"1067\" dur=\"4.2\">mein little Russell and we&amp;#39;re kids</text><text start=\"1069.22\" dur=\"5.19\">Principia Mathematica which she took</text><text start=\"1071.2\" dur=\"4.71\">them together about ten jenny zurawell</text><text start=\"1074.41\" dur=\"4.02\">Russell wrote the principles of</text><text start=\"1075.91\" dur=\"4.41\">mathematics in nineteen three where he</text><text start=\"1078.43\" dur=\"4.2\">does Ricky Martin went to Prague I think</text><text start=\"1080.32\" dur=\"4.56\">in the preparation and India periods</text><text start=\"1082.63\" dur=\"5.52\">yes and then then he went on with his</text><text start=\"1084.88\" dur=\"5.67\">Vidya tutor at twenty Cambridge</text><text start=\"1088.15\" dur=\"4.74\">Whitehead to write a free volume work</text><text start=\"1090.55\" dur=\"5.16\">called Panchita Mathematica in which he</text><text start=\"1092.89\" dur=\"5.22\">actually tried to do the work of</text><text start=\"1095.71\" dur=\"5.97\">reducing mathematics from logic and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"1098.11\" dur=\"5.82\">full of formulae and because it gives a</text><text start=\"1101.68\" dur=\"5.28\">stupendous work although as you rightly</text><text start=\"1103.93\" dur=\"4.89\">said it doesn&amp;#39;t quite achieve the</text><text start=\"1106.96\" dur=\"4.11\">standards about the rigor that the fair</text><text start=\"1108.82\" dur=\"4.26\">girl achieved before it but this was the</text><text start=\"1111.07\" dur=\"3.39\">one that really popular rides or</text><text start=\"1113.08\" dur=\"3.45\">subjects then all sorts of people took</text><text start=\"1114.46\" dur=\"4.62\">it out but it man it took four men on it</text><text start=\"1116.53\" dur=\"4.56\">has proceeded by leaps and bounds and</text><text start=\"1119.08\" dur=\"3.42\">it&amp;#39;s now so to speak a major field of</text><text start=\"1121.09\" dur=\"3.33\">intellectual endeavor throughout the</text><text start=\"1122.5\" dur=\"3.57\">Mayan world in every universe but is</text><text start=\"1124.42\" dur=\"4.35\">interesting I think also should be</text><text start=\"1126.07\" dur=\"6.42\">mentioned that one of the effects has</text><text start=\"1128.77\" dur=\"5.55\">been not so much to subdue mathematics</text><text start=\"1132.49\" dur=\"3.99\">or logic which is what Sega and Russell</text><text start=\"1134.32\" dur=\"5.79\">wanted but subdued oddity mathematics</text><text start=\"1136.48\" dur=\"5.85\">and the in recent years seem</text><text start=\"1140.11\" dur=\"5.04\">mathematical logic has become more and</text><text start=\"1142.33\" dur=\"5.91\">more mathematical and less and has had</text><text start=\"1145.15\" dur=\"6.41\">less less to do with fluffy in general</text><text start=\"1148.24\" dur=\"6\">and even a disciple of figure like</text><text start=\"1151.56\" dur=\"4.63\">Michel damage is more interested in the</text><text start=\"1154.24\" dur=\"3.66\">semantic side of it the theory of</text><text start=\"1156.19\" dur=\"3.48\">meaning that he had hitherto said</text><text start=\"1157.9\" dur=\"4.2\">himself to be in the column as radical</text><text start=\"1159.67\" dur=\"4.38\">side but unlike Frager Russell actually</text><text start=\"1162.1\" dur=\"3.93\">made the explicit step after we&amp;#39;ve done</text><text start=\"1164.05\" dur=\"4.5\">all this work to general philosophy</text><text start=\"1166.03\" dur=\"4.59\">early not until he was 40 years old but</text><text start=\"1168.55\" dur=\"4.86\">then he did and he started producing</text><text start=\"1170.62\" dur=\"5.76\">general works of philosophy can you give</text><text start=\"1173.41\" dur=\"5.43\">us some indication of what position well</text><text start=\"1176.38\" dur=\"8.04\">it&amp;#39;s very odd how little two are</text><text start=\"1178.84\" dur=\"7.2\">connected they one place where as they</text><text start=\"1184.42\" dur=\"5.4\">are connected is something a buffer</text><text start=\"1186.04\" dur=\"7.92\">called the theory of descriptions there</text><text start=\"1189.82\" dur=\"6.99\">was a puzzle about the meaning of our</text><text start=\"1193.96\" dur=\"4.74\">statements like the present King of</text><text start=\"1196.81\" dur=\"3.09\">France which didn&amp;#39;t know</text><text start=\"1198.7\" dur=\"3.12\">what did you say the president king of</text><text start=\"1199.9\" dur=\"4.29\">France is bald yet there isn&amp;#39;t anything</text><text start=\"1201.82\" dur=\"3.3\">up front I never and didn&amp;#39;t know</text><text start=\"1204.19\" dur=\"3.48\">anything and therefore there was a</text><text start=\"1205.12\" dur=\"4.77\">question hi could be meaningful and they</text><text start=\"1207.67\" dur=\"5.3\">had been philosophers a medical example</text><text start=\"1209.89\" dur=\"6.24\">is a German called my nan who then</text><text start=\"1212.97\" dur=\"5.41\">thought of that these things no he what</text><text start=\"1216.13\" dur=\"6.09\">he called subsystem entities and Russell</text><text start=\"1218.38\" dur=\"6.09\">forces rubbish and he shared a way of</text><text start=\"1222.22\" dur=\"5.73\">translating out such expressions by</text><text start=\"1224.47\" dur=\"7.68\">saying that say in fact contained cavett</text><text start=\"1227.95\" dur=\"8.04\">existence claims and causes in board saw</text><text start=\"1232.15\" dur=\"5.94\">same into there is one thing that now</text><text start=\"1235.99\" dur=\"3.48\">rules over France and whatever it is</text><text start=\"1238.09\" dur=\"5.04\">over France is bald</text><text start=\"1239.47\" dur=\"6.21\">okay and this got rid of the of the</text><text start=\"1243.13\" dur=\"5.73\">apparent paradox and so in that way is</text><text start=\"1245.68\" dur=\"5.34\">not for work edifice or implication but</text><text start=\"1248.86\" dur=\"5.07\">in the main he simply went off from</text><text start=\"1251.02\" dur=\"6.54\">mallet axe he says surely philosophical</text><text start=\"1253.93\" dur=\"5.52\">book came out 1912 it&amp;#39;s called the</text><text start=\"1257.56\" dur=\"4.92\">problems of loss racial home university</text><text start=\"1259.45\" dur=\"4.62\">library book and in my view still the</text><text start=\"1262.48\" dur=\"3.42\">best introductions of losses there is</text><text start=\"1264.07\" dur=\"3.63\">because ruffles a marvelous writer</text><text start=\"1265.9\" dur=\"4.5\">though it&amp;#39;s a good old-fashioned and</text><text start=\"1267.7\" dur=\"5.37\">there he really takes no account he&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"1270.4\" dur=\"4.53\">also look at all he simply continues the</text><text start=\"1273.07\" dur=\"3.68\">British imperialist edition this is a</text><text start=\"1274.93\" dur=\"4.74\">book and follows straight on from</text><text start=\"1276.75\" dur=\"4.54\">Berkeley Locke park in Hume and it</text><text start=\"1279.67\" dur=\"4.17\">starts off with the failure of</text><text start=\"1281.29\" dur=\"3.96\">perceptions they like Berkeley there it</text><text start=\"1283.84\" dur=\"3.72\">says that what we perceive and not</text><text start=\"1285.25\" dur=\"4.44\">stables and jazz and things but what</text><text start=\"1287.56\" dur=\"5.25\">barking but Locke called simple ideas</text><text start=\"1289.69\" dur=\"6.57\">what Russell following his friend work</text><text start=\"1292.81\" dur=\"6.27\">or sin theta and then another recent</text><text start=\"1296.26\" dur=\"5.07\">audience awful question how on the basis</text><text start=\"1299.08\" dur=\"4.02\">of being presented with the st.</text><text start=\"1301.33\" dur=\"3.93\">impressions we arrive at physical</text><text start=\"1303.1\" dur=\"5.07\">objects so then he deals is the sense</text><text start=\"1305.26\" dur=\"8.28\">additional to suffer problems in in that</text><text start=\"1308.17\" dur=\"7.25\">sort of way and he more or less gave up</text><text start=\"1313.54\" dur=\"5.54\">logic after</text><text start=\"1315.42\" dur=\"8.77\">consumed animatic ieave self said that</text><text start=\"1319.08\" dur=\"7.12\">this wore him out he collaborated in the</text><text start=\"1324.19\" dur=\"3.93\">books on a book with Whitehead but</text><text start=\"1326.2\" dur=\"4.89\">Whitehead was teaching mathematics at</text><text start=\"1328.12\" dur=\"4.41\">Cambridge and mainly occupied was that</text><text start=\"1331.09\" dur=\"3.66\">Russell that</text><text start=\"1332.53\" dur=\"3.96\">was living independently already had a</text><text start=\"1334.75\" dur=\"3.99\">lectureship at a mixer and I could get</text><text start=\"1336.49\" dur=\"4.05\">that 15 but in the first decade of the</text><text start=\"1338.74\" dur=\"4.95\">century he was living on his independent</text><text start=\"1340.54\" dur=\"5.46\">income and so he had @y actual worker</text><text start=\"1343.69\" dur=\"6.33\">back at all his proofs and he shared</text><text start=\"1346\" dur=\"5.85\">that this really fascinated him ever</text><text start=\"1350.02\" dur=\"5.07\">doing any detailed work in future and</text><text start=\"1351.85\" dur=\"6\">some extent true all his later work is</text><text start=\"1355.09\" dur=\"5.04\">full of brilliant ideas he never he no</text><text start=\"1357.85\" dur=\"3.66\">fully works out it doesn&amp;#39;t get bored</text><text start=\"1360.13\" dur=\"3.72\">he&amp;#39;s obviously it goes on like this oh</text><text start=\"1361.51\" dur=\"5.85\">he doesn&amp;#39;t bother to dot the i&amp;#39;s and</text><text start=\"1363.85\" dur=\"6.03\">cross the two awards go to work I think</text><text start=\"1367.36\" dur=\"4.02\">that I see one very important continuing</text><text start=\"1369.88\" dur=\"2.85\">concern in the later work I&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start=\"1371.38\" dur=\"3.75\">should know if you agree with this or</text><text start=\"1372.73\" dur=\"4.38\">not you&amp;#39;ve just said I&amp;#39;m sure rightly</text><text start=\"1375.13\" dur=\"3.66\">that that Russell was a radical</text><text start=\"1377.11\" dur=\"4.59\">empiricist you know a direct tradition</text><text start=\"1378.79\" dur=\"4.86\">of Locke and humanly it seems to me the</text><text start=\"1381.7\" dur=\"5.49\">Brussels was always concerned to</text><text start=\"1383.65\" dur=\"6.45\">validate the Natural Sciences in terms</text><text start=\"1387.19\" dur=\"4.68\">of sense data that he always wanted to</text><text start=\"1390.1\" dur=\"3.96\">show that the whole corpus of our</text><text start=\"1391.87\" dur=\"4.98\">scientific knowledge could be derived</text><text start=\"1394.06\" dur=\"5.19\">from and was derived from nothing but</text><text start=\"1396.85\" dur=\"5.19\">observations and our reflections on our</text><text start=\"1399.25\" dur=\"5.28\">object well not always</text><text start=\"1402.04\" dur=\"4.77\">I think you&amp;#39;ll make one very important</text><text start=\"1404.53\" dur=\"5.37\">to important point here and well in fact</text><text start=\"1406.81\" dur=\"4.68\">that I overlooked when I was talking a</text><text start=\"1409.9\" dur=\"4.68\">few moments ago and that is that from</text><text start=\"1411.49\" dur=\"5.25\">the very beginning Russell&amp;#39;s approaches</text><text start=\"1414.58\" dur=\"4.68\">philosophy was an interesting</text><text start=\"1416.74\" dur=\"5.28\">justification of reading using story</text><text start=\"1419.26\" dur=\"4.86\">that when use about 12 his older brother</text><text start=\"1422.02\" dur=\"3.96\">who was said to school Russell to store</text><text start=\"1424.12\" dur=\"4.88\">at home the other brother Franco said</text><text start=\"1425.98\" dur=\"5.76\">school taught Russell geometry and</text><text start=\"1429\" dur=\"4.72\">Russell refused to accept the actions he</text><text start=\"1431.74\" dur=\"4.68\">wanted to have improved and mibella said</text><text start=\"1433.72\" dur=\"4.29\">that they couldn&amp;#39;t get on mystic you got</text><text start=\"1436.42\" dur=\"4.95\">to exhibit the actions they agreed to</text><text start=\"1438.01\" dur=\"5.46\">originally but he always wanted to have</text><text start=\"1441.37\" dur=\"3.93\">everything justified and this was common</text><text start=\"1443.47\" dur=\"3.93\">both in his approach to logical</text><text start=\"1445.3\" dur=\"3.99\">mathematics and his approach to other</text><text start=\"1447.4\" dur=\"4.02\">branches of knowledge and as you say</text><text start=\"1449.29\" dur=\"5.1\">also means opposed to science he wanted</text><text start=\"1451.42\" dur=\"8.15\">to have a spacious flower buddy concerns</text><text start=\"1454.39\" dur=\"9.06\">and but here he is used buried in the</text><text start=\"1459.57\" dur=\"5.89\">book I mentioned a problem with</text><text start=\"1463.45\" dur=\"2.79\">philosophy it&amp;#39;s quite rude he won&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"1465.46\" dur=\"3.09\">start</text><text start=\"1466.24\" dur=\"4.2\">sense-data but he didn&amp;#39;t think that all</text><text start=\"1468.55\" dur=\"4.05\">scientific or even nor a common-sense</text><text start=\"1470.44\" dur=\"4.2\">statement save as I had a disabled can</text><text start=\"1472.6\" dur=\"5.46\">be could be reduced to sensory statement</text><text start=\"1474.64\" dur=\"6.66\">he adopted a causal theory that you</text><text start=\"1478.06\" dur=\"5.67\">could assume the existence of physical</text><text start=\"1481.3\" dur=\"5.58\">world as the best explanation for our</text><text start=\"1483.73\" dur=\"5.88\">sensory experiences then he changed his</text><text start=\"1486.88\" dur=\"4.89\">view and in the next important book that</text><text start=\"1489.61\" dur=\"4.86\">he published on theory of knowledge</text><text start=\"1491.77\" dur=\"6.93\">which was a larger the external world</text><text start=\"1494.47\" dur=\"7.08\">which came out in 1914 he did take the</text><text start=\"1498.7\" dur=\"4.38\">view you just you just referred to</text><text start=\"1501.55\" dur=\"4.77\">namely he thought you could actually</text><text start=\"1503.08\" dur=\"5.22\">reduce every mother and every common</text><text start=\"1506.32\" dur=\"4.47\">sense statement very scientific</text><text start=\"1508.3\" dur=\"6.03\">statement to statements about our actual</text><text start=\"1510.79\" dur=\"5.61\">and had possible hypothetical assent</text><text start=\"1514.33\" dur=\"4.83\">experiences and this year is this food</text><text start=\"1516.4\" dur=\"5.81\">this

dur=\"4.62\">and then I say called something like</text><text start=\"1552.82\" dur=\"5.36\">sense data and physics is the most</text><text start=\"1554.65\" dur=\"6.57\">important lambda and he continued this</text><text start=\"1558.18\" dur=\"5.59\">in another important book called</text><text start=\"1561.22\" dur=\"6.18\">analysis of mind which came out I think</text><text start=\"1563.77\" dur=\"5.49\">in 1921 and he adopted a theory which</text><text start=\"1567.4\" dur=\"5.27\">had been advanced before him by the</text><text start=\"1569.26\" dur=\"6.87\">pragmatist William James Henry James&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"1572.67\" dur=\"6.4\">elder brother in which both mind and</text><text start=\"1576.13\" dur=\"5.79\">matter were composed of what James</text><text start=\"1579.07\" dur=\"6.03\">called neutral stuff and which were</text><text start=\"1581.92\" dur=\"5.55\">wearing fact since data and images and</text><text start=\"1585.1\" dur=\"3.9\">then they differed only in being</text><text start=\"1587.47\" dur=\"4.11\">different arrangements with fundamental</text><text start=\"1589\" dur=\"6.39\">data but then Russell gave this up and</text><text start=\"1591.58\" dur=\"6.96\">in 925 will emphasize the curious forged</text><text start=\"1595.39\" dur=\"3.95\">as no matter where he where that places</text><text start=\"1598.54\" dur=\"2.66\">issues too</text><text start=\"1599.34\" dur=\"5.01\">remaining but he mainly went back to the</text><text start=\"1601.2\" dur=\"6.99\">causal theory that that he&amp;#39;d held in</text><text start=\"1604.35\" dur=\"7.89\">1912 and when he revived his interested</text><text start=\"1608.19\" dur=\"8.21\">philosophy in the 1940s and any final</text><text start=\"1612.24\" dur=\"7.32\">through all his next last Rosasco book</text><text start=\"1616.4\" dur=\"5.08\">human largest open limits he goes back</text><text start=\"1619.56\" dur=\"3.86\">to a causal theory he always he always</text><text start=\"1621.48\" dur=\"8.31\">thought that the basis of our knowledge</text><text start=\"1623.42\" dur=\"12.73\">was laying in sense variance but he</text><text start=\"1629.79\" dur=\"8.13\">varied in in the next step I mean it was</text><text start=\"1636.15\" dur=\"3.56\">only during one period of his work that</text><text start=\"1637.92\" dur=\"6.78\">he thought that the whole thing could be</text><text start=\"1639.71\" dur=\"6.58\">reduced to centric term more often and</text><text start=\"1644.7\" dur=\"3.93\">certainly in a lot of the enemies like</text><text start=\"1646.29\" dur=\"4.77\">very violently he he had he had the</text><text start=\"1648.63\" dur=\"6.39\">causal theory which put the physical</text><text start=\"1651.06\" dur=\"5.67\">world beyond the veil observation in</text><text start=\"1655.02\" dur=\"4.07\">fact he ended up with very curious what</text><text start=\"1656.73\" dur=\"5.58\">is the attempt to bring a wholly new</text><text start=\"1659.09\" dur=\"5.56\">rigor to bear he&amp;#39;ll also say not only of</text><text start=\"1662.31\" dur=\"5.01\">a logical kind but once tempted to say</text><text start=\"1664.65\" dur=\"4.98\">the scientific kind he was always very</text><text start=\"1667.32\" dur=\"4.71\">concerned for example that our beliefs</text><text start=\"1669.63\" dur=\"4.47\">should relate to the evidence form which</text><text start=\"1672.03\" dur=\"3.96\">is something he reiterated over and over</text><text start=\"1674.1\" dur=\"4.77\">again isn&amp;#39;t it and it&amp;#39;s something which</text><text start=\"1675.99\" dur=\"5.13\">if taken seriously sweeps aside a great</text><text start=\"1678.87\" dur=\"4.23\">deal of traditional philosophizing and</text><text start=\"1681.12\" dur=\"4.41\">traditional thinking oh yes that let any</text><text start=\"1683.1\" dur=\"6.63\">is true and I think that this you</text><text start=\"1685.53\" dur=\"6.18\">already mentioned that Russell and in</text><text start=\"1689.73\" dur=\"8.61\">from Vicki Stein indeed the concern was</text><text start=\"1691.71\" dur=\"9.57\">Russell&amp;#39;s bookable and as you know</text><text start=\"1698.34\" dur=\"4.73\">Wickham Stein and also that goof losses</text><text start=\"1701.28\" dur=\"3.96\">in Vienna called the Vienna circle</text><text start=\"1703.07\" dur=\"5.16\">condemned what they call better physics</text><text start=\"1705.24\" dur=\"5.7\">and metaphysics in their view was</text><text start=\"1708.23\" dur=\"5.26\">participative least partly any attempt</text><text start=\"1710.94\" dur=\"4.68\">to describe and the world in non</text><text start=\"1713.49\" dur=\"6.5\">scientific terms they thought that this</text><text start=\"1715.62\" dur=\"6.93\">was the only world there is and the sand</text><text start=\"1719.99\" dur=\"5.17\">was a method of forming theories about</text><text start=\"1722.55\" dur=\"5.73\">it which are verified by observation and</text><text start=\"1725.16\" dur=\"6.06\">any assumptions were most superior world</text><text start=\"1728.28\" dur=\"4.98\">a world inhabited by God&amp;#39;s when he that</text><text start=\"1731.22\" dur=\"5.67\">sought was nonsensical and</text><text start=\"1733.26\" dur=\"6.299\">certainly all the time held this and was</text><text start=\"1736.89\" dur=\"5.039\">always concerned to just write sound and</text><text start=\"1739.559\" dur=\"3.781\">was always worried by the back he</text><text start=\"1741.929\" dur=\"3.75\">thought a justification for sounds</text><text start=\"1743.34\" dur=\"3.87\">extremely problematic yeah I mean and it</text><text start=\"1745.679\" dur=\"3.691\">remained a problematic to the end to the</text><text start=\"1747.21\" dur=\"5.099\">end I mean and in the interesting in in</text><text start=\"1749.37\" dur=\"5.13\">the last book that he wrote only Salah</text><text start=\"1752.309\" dur=\"5.281\">Segovia&amp;#39;s was a book he then sets out</text><text start=\"1754.5\" dur=\"6.33\">what he thinks are the set of</text><text start=\"1757.59\" dur=\"6.06\">assumptions of the party made if belief</text><text start=\"1760.83\" dur=\"5.19\">in sattvic theories is to be justified</text><text start=\"1763.65\" dur=\"5.97\">and makes it quite clear do you think</text><text start=\"1766.02\" dur=\"7.47\">these assumptions must be taken on faith</text><text start=\"1769.62\" dur=\"5.97\">yeah and he tried to work out what we</text><text start=\"1773.49\" dur=\"4.23\">called a theory of induction but was</text><text start=\"1775.59\" dur=\"4.53\">never entirely satisfied with it and</text><text start=\"1777.72\" dur=\"4.679\">more or less said well I mean I remember</text><text start=\"1780.12\" dur=\"4.919\">what he said he said that we really</text><text start=\"1782.399\" dur=\"4.65\">can&amp;#39;t be sure science is true but it has</text><text start=\"1785.039\" dur=\"4.981\">a greater chance of being true than</text><text start=\"1787.049\" dur=\"5.37\">anything else but we survival his rival</text><text start=\"1790.02\" dur=\"3.96\">yes so he still couldn&amp;#39;t validate it in</text><text start=\"1792.419\" dur=\"3.271\">the way he couldn&amp;#39;t very dated may you&amp;#39;d</text><text start=\"1793.98\" dur=\"3.39\">like to know in like no time</text><text start=\"1795.69\" dur=\"3.93\">let&amp;#39;s just talk now in an orderly way</text><text start=\"1797.37\" dur=\"5.13\">about the influence of Russell because</text><text start=\"1799.62\" dur=\"5.159\">he and Vidkun Stein I suppose must be</text><text start=\"1802.5\" dur=\"3.779\">the two most influential flog years in</text><text start=\"1804.779\" dur=\"3.811\">the 20th century at least in the</text><text start=\"1806.279\" dur=\"5.041\">english-speaking world now I suppose</text><text start=\"1808.59\" dur=\"5.27\">Russell&amp;#39;s first ratings was on his</text><text start=\"1811.32\" dur=\"4.859\">immediate contemporaries and indeed OTA</text><text start=\"1813.86\" dur=\"6.549\">and their influence on him is there</text><text start=\"1816.179\" dur=\"9.421\">everyone yeah I mean well it&amp;#39;s better</text><text start=\"1820.409\" dur=\"8.76\">for the best in in the purely logical</text><text start=\"1825.6\" dur=\"6.11\">work which was promoted collaborated he</text><text start=\"1829.169\" dur=\"4.86\">was I think Russell who had the</text><text start=\"1831.71\" dur=\"5.02\">molesting idea of and I think theory of</text><text start=\"1834.029\" dur=\"5.341\">types was their description came from</text><text start=\"1836.73\" dur=\"4.35\">Russell but when he came to trying to</text><text start=\"1839.37\" dur=\"4.679\">apply that sort of technique to floss</text><text start=\"1841.08\" dur=\"4.44\">famous research said Russell did in our</text><text start=\"1844.049\" dur=\"4.23\">knowledge of the external world for</text><text start=\"1845.52\" dur=\"6.21\">example in trying to reduce</text><text start=\"1848.279\" dur=\"6.961\">abstract concepts like concepts of</text><text start=\"1851.73\" dur=\"5.64\">points and instance to operational terms</text><text start=\"1855.24\" dur=\"3.9\">then it was Whitehead who took the lead</text><text start=\"1857.37\" dur=\"3.48\">and was regarded idea of the racket and</text><text start=\"1859.14\" dur=\"4.62\">he&amp;#39;d they quarreled over this because</text><text start=\"1860.85\" dur=\"4.23\">the Russell didn&amp;#39;t say what a decision</text><text start=\"1863.76\" dur=\"2.64\">development your friend was very</text><text start=\"1865.08\" dur=\"3.84\">developed in two books</text><text start=\"1866.4\" dur=\"4.23\">I came out after all the principles of</text><text start=\"1868.92\" dur=\"6.36\">natural knowledge regardless of nature</text><text start=\"1870.63\" dur=\"6.48\">and Russell at one time was influenced</text><text start=\"1875.28\" dur=\"5.22\">by McTaggart who was the disciple of</text><text start=\"1877.11\" dur=\"6.93\">Hegel and God rustled to be both Russell</text><text start=\"1880.5\" dur=\"5.28\">Moore to be n to be idealist and were</text><text start=\"1884.04\" dur=\"3.12\">first of all rebelled against the</text><text start=\"1885.78\" dur=\"4.26\">interests of common sense</text><text start=\"1887.16\" dur=\"4.8\">Warwick defender of common sense and the</text><text start=\"1890.04\" dur=\"5.1\">inference russell to accept that he that</text><text start=\"1891.96\" dur=\"4.74\">he cured russ already belief in idealism</text><text start=\"1895.14\" dur=\"4.83\">so this is the aims of them france went</text><text start=\"1896.7\" dur=\"4.2\">that way also it was respect to ethics</text><text start=\"1899.97\" dur=\"3.15\">some truffles they were greatly</text><text start=\"1900.9\" dur=\"4.53\">interested he accepted like all bloom</text><text start=\"1903.12\" dur=\"3.99\">spray he accepted more specific i</text><text start=\"1905.43\" dur=\"7.44\">believe that good was a non-natural</text><text start=\"1907.11\" dur=\"8.61\">indefinable concept sorry but then a</text><text start=\"1912.87\" dur=\"6.69\">Russell has very big influence on the</text><text start=\"1915.72\" dur=\"6.99\">later for my generation of philosophers</text><text start=\"1919.56\" dur=\"6.3\">it is nothing he convinced us that since</text><text start=\"1922.71\" dur=\"5.93\">sound so sovereign in the description of</text><text start=\"1925.86\" dur=\"5.4\">the world or lust they could do was he</text><text start=\"1928.64\" dur=\"4.66\">elucidated analyze and so Russell to me</text><text start=\"1931.26\" dur=\"4.56\">in regard that he gets the father of</text><text start=\"1933.3\" dur=\"5.22\">analysis but he any difference</text><text start=\"1935.82\" dur=\"4.92\">profoundly from victim Stein I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"1938.52\" dur=\"4.44\">want to go too deeply to be concerned</text><text start=\"1940.74\" dur=\"3.24\">but well I&amp;#39;d rather you didn&amp;#39;t because</text><text start=\"1942.96\" dur=\"2.76\">they&amp;#39;re going to debate the whole you</text><text start=\"1943.98\" dur=\"3.75\">make a diagram but one things will come</text><text start=\"1945.72\" dur=\"4.17\">on next where m is the biggest giant of</text><text start=\"1947.73\" dur=\"4.95\">the floss he was largely a matter of</text><text start=\"1949.89\" dur=\"4.47\">people be getting into a muddle and the</text><text start=\"1952.68\" dur=\"4.98\">business of people like because I&amp;#39;m used</text><text start=\"1954.36\" dur=\"5.04\">to a genie turned the famous face show</text><text start=\"1957.66\" dur=\"3.57\">the fly the way out of a fire bottle to</text><text start=\"1959.4\" dur=\"4.05\">kill people of these models well as also</text><text start=\"1961.23\" dur=\"3.9\">always thought that philosophical</text><text start=\"1963.45\" dur=\"5.07\">problems had a solution</text><text start=\"1965.13\" dur=\"5.91\">and that was why he was so exposed to</text><text start=\"1968.52\" dur=\"4.98\">the purely linguistic philosophy of our</text><text start=\"1971.04\" dur=\"6.48\">production after war and the leadership</text><text start=\"1973.5\" dur=\"6.84\">of us in burritos the mere explanation</text><text start=\"1977.52\" dur=\"4.89\">of language which then sake really the</text><text start=\"1980.34\" dur=\"5.82\">exploration of the implications of</text><text start=\"1982.41\" dur=\"4.89\">English usage was trivial and Russell</text><text start=\"1986.16\" dur=\"4.25\">really thought of there were questions</text><text start=\"1987.3\" dur=\"6.09\">about justification of our beliefs that</text><text start=\"1990.41\" dur=\"5.38\">it was business losses to answer and</text><text start=\"1993.39\" dur=\"3.93\">these questions were answerable he</text><text start=\"1995.79\" dur=\"3.24\">thought that the answers could be</text><text start=\"1997.32\" dur=\"2.76\">discovered if you were to get all about</text><text start=\"1999.03\" dur=\"3.21\">alibi didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start=\"2000.08\" dur=\"3.45\">we&amp;#39;re doing I thought yet I do yes I</text><text start=\"2002.24\" dur=\"3.39\">could say I want to put a personal</text><text start=\"2003.53\" dur=\"3.9\">question - because you own your life you</text><text start=\"2005.63\" dur=\"3.9\">have acknowledged that you yourself have</text><text start=\"2007.43\" dur=\"5.31\">been enormous um so it laughs Solomon</text><text start=\"2009.53\" dur=\"5.37\">reverence yes it always have so you can</text><text start=\"2012.74\" dur=\"4.05\">tell us what it&amp;#39;s like from the inside</text><text start=\"2014.9\" dur=\"2.88\">as it were to have been influenced by</text><text start=\"2016.79\" dur=\"3.12\">Russell</text><text start=\"2017.78\" dur=\"6.03\">what is his influence being on you on me</text><text start=\"2019.91\" dur=\"6.96\">uh it&amp;#39;s been first of all but unlike</text><text start=\"2023.81\" dur=\"5.19\">most of my contemporaries I still think</text><text start=\"2026.87\" dur=\"5.1\">I should start with what Russell called</text><text start=\"2029\" dur=\"5.34\">sense data what I not read call since</text><text start=\"2031.97\" dur=\"7.59\">qualia that is a technical difference</text><text start=\"2034.34\" dur=\"9.03\">whether you begin with particulars or or</text><text start=\"2039.56\" dur=\"6.27\">something more general but he says that</text><text start=\"2043.37\" dur=\"7.559\">example same thing so that on the whole</text><text start=\"2045.83\" dur=\"8.07\">I share his some certainly the starting</text><text start=\"2050.929\" dur=\"4.951\">point which is on perception I share him</text><text start=\"2053.9\" dur=\"2.67\">I also agree with the importance of</text><text start=\"2055.88\" dur=\"4.04\">primacy</text><text start=\"2056.57\" dur=\"6.75\">he attaches to the theory of knowledge I</text><text start=\"2059.92\" dur=\"6.7\">am and the law I&amp;#39;ve always been a</text><text start=\"2063.32\" dur=\"5.82\">thoroughgoing empiricist I agree with</text><text start=\"2066.62\" dur=\"5.25\">the view of the Russell derived from</text><text start=\"2069.14\" dur=\"5.25\">human own a safety of a magical</text><text start=\"2071.87\" dur=\"5.15\">sensitive so that the such a thing as</text><text start=\"2074.39\" dur=\"6.57\">cause of this because well just remember</text><text start=\"2077.02\" dur=\"5.92\">what Hume originally said it was namely</text><text start=\"2080.96\" dur=\"4.709\">constant conjunction and something</text><text start=\"2082.94\" dur=\"5.46\">purely contingent I agree with Russell</text><text start=\"2085.669\" dur=\"4.771\">in rejecting any form of theology or any</text><text start=\"2088.4\" dur=\"3.54\">how transcendent theology injecting</text><text start=\"2090.44\" dur=\"4.68\">metaphysics right also most importantly</text><text start=\"2091.94\" dur=\"5.37\">a view is Russell the frost wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text><text start=\"2095.12\" dur=\"4.29\">worth doing unless you&amp;#39;d pose questions</text><text start=\"2097.31\" dur=\"4.89\">which we could find the answers that&amp;#39;s</text><text start=\"2099.41\" dur=\"4.98\">not he bets that I took camera persons</text><text start=\"2102.2\" dur=\"3.87\">but I will eventually idea and all these</text><text start=\"2104.39\" dur=\"3.72\">are examples not just to be or degree in</text><text start=\"2106.07\" dur=\"4.17\">with him but at him having influence oh</text><text start=\"2108.11\" dur=\"3.99\">yes are they all of them quickly yes</text><text start=\"2110.24\" dur=\"3.36\">guys directly exactly and I think the</text><text start=\"2112.1\" dur=\"3.36\">reason been to inspire him in the way</text><text start=\"2113.6\" dur=\"3.69\">you bite haven&amp;#39;t with that well I you</text><text start=\"2115.46\" dur=\"4.05\">regard him as a mastering each pillars</text><text start=\"2117.29\" dur=\"3.63\">and well I think I&amp;#39;m not in the same</text><text start=\"2119.51\" dur=\"4.38\">class as Russell&amp;#39;s Lhasa</text><text start=\"2120.92\" dur=\"4.89\">but I do think that I do write English</text><text start=\"2123.89\" dur=\"3.66\">reasonably well and I do get again</text><text start=\"2125.81\" dur=\"3.42\">partly under his influence and in-game</text><text start=\"2127.55\" dur=\"5.9\">question yes I think that was</text><text start=\"2129.23\" dur=\"8.69\">affiliation both of ideas and style</text><text start=\"2133.45\" dur=\"8.159\">from Hume through mill to Russell and</text><text start=\"2137.92\" dur=\"6.06\">coming down and said to me now the</text><text start=\"2141.609\" dur=\"4.921\">philosophers will be discussing it here</text><text start=\"2143.98\" dur=\"4.44\">Trager and Russell had enormous effect</text><text start=\"2146.53\" dur=\"4.68\">on the milling yourself included now I</text><text start=\"2148.42\" dur=\"4.98\">want to talk about the revival of</text><text start=\"2151.21\" dur=\"4.05\">interest in fraida after the Second</text><text start=\"2153.4\" dur=\"3.54\">World War so that the interest in Frager</text><text start=\"2155.26\" dur=\"5.22\">can be interested in Russell for the</text><text start=\"2156.94\" dur=\"6.06\">first time proceed side by side into the</text><text start=\"2160.48\" dur=\"4.77\">age that we now live in it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start=\"2163\" dur=\"5.24\">difficult to account for historical</text><text start=\"2165.25\" dur=\"6.17\">events particularly in such short of</text><text start=\"2168.24\" dur=\"6.129\">perspective and the Attic see if the</text><text start=\"2171.42\" dur=\"5.62\">certainly was in immediate reward</text><text start=\"2174.369\" dur=\"4.74\">decline in Russell&amp;#39;s insolence in high</text><text start=\"2177.04\" dur=\"8.09\">earnings only and this is addict knock</text><text start=\"2179.109\" dur=\"8.49\">you to revival register Sega but to an</text><text start=\"2185.13\" dur=\"5.32\">increased importance attached to the</text><text start=\"2187.599\" dur=\"4.801\">work of Vic and Stein and more in worst</text><text start=\"2190.45\" dur=\"3.69\">case so I enormous li-like to infection</text><text start=\"2192.4\" dur=\"5.52\">as a man I think philosophically it was</text><text start=\"2194.14\" dur=\"6.15\">excessive and I think this was just to</text><text start=\"2197.92\" dur=\"4.199\">the responsiveness for partly not a</text><text start=\"2200.29\" dur=\"5.1\">trial who respected Russell but mainly</text><text start=\"2202.119\" dur=\"5.25\">Austin who was the linguistic</text><text start=\"2205.39\" dur=\"4.729\">philosopher and narrow as possible sense</text><text start=\"2207.369\" dur=\"5.641\">and had a great respect for more as as</text><text start=\"2210.119\" dur=\"4.75\">someone who - great importance tour</text><text start=\"2213.01\" dur=\"3.63\">during his huges of the common sense and</text><text start=\"2214.869\" dur=\"3.421\">so on common sense as said by Russell</text><text start=\"2216.64\" dur=\"4.82\">incidentally the metaphysics of savages</text><text start=\"2218.29\" dur=\"6.029\">and I think it was the upgrading of more</text><text start=\"2221.46\" dur=\"4.81\">that was responsible for at that time to</text><text start=\"2224.319\" dur=\"3.841\">downgrade Nebraska and this is it
